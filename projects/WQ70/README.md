Peter Olsen 12/2015

Convert data to format that can be added to 
Mystic River Watershed Associations database.

extract the table with data and edit the table from resulting .xlsx file.  
Convert to .csv formate 
The edits are focused on accuracy, maintaining the original layout of data so it
can be verified from PDF report, 
 laid out so a script can read and manipulate the data.
